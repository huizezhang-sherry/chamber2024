People can talk about a whole range of different things when they refer to their data as spatio-temporal!

```{r}
stations_sf <- cubble::climate_aus |> as_tibble() %>% select(-ts) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = 4283, remove = FALSE)
oz <- ozmaps::abs_ste %>% filter(NAME != "Other Territories")
oz_simp <- oz %>% rmapshaper::ms_simplify(keep = 0.05) 
vector <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = oz_simp, fill = "grey95", color = "white") +
  geom_point(data = stations_sf, aes(long,lat)) + 
  ggthemes::theme_map() + 
  ggtitle("Vector")
raster <- GGally::nasa %>% 
  filter(year == 1995) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = temperature)) + 
  geom_raster() + 
  theme_bw() +  
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1, legend.position = "none") + 
  ggtitle("Raster")
trajectory <- dplyr::storms %>% 
  filter(status == "hurricane") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = interaction(name, year))) + 
  geom_path(size = 0.5) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle("Trajectory") 
```

```{r}
vector | raster | trajectory
```

The focus of today will be on vector data.

::: {.notes}

Here we have three different types: vector, raster, trajectory data (explain each)

vector data have time series measured at a collection of locations

raster data use gridded cells to represent a continuous space and each cell, or pixel, has variables measured at different time points. An example of raster data could be satellite images. 

There is also trajectory data where points are moving in the space and time in the same time. This type of data can be found in ecology to track animal movements.

In my talk today, we will focus on vector data. But I want to start by giving you the big picture.

::: notes

  - Today I will introduce a new data structure, called cubble, for vector spatio-temporal data

  - in short, cubble is a nested object built on tibble that allow easy pivoting between spatial and temporal form.
  
  - we will first talk about how the two forms look like and then how you cna pivot beween them for different tasks.
  
  - In the nested form, spatial variables are in columns out and temporal variables are nested into a list column called `ts`
  
  - In the long form, the time series data are shown in columns and each row is cross identified by the site and date in a long table

## [Cubble: a spatio-temporal vector data structure]{.r-fit-text}

Cubble is a nested object built on tibble that allow easy pivoting between spatial and temporal form.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/cubble-operations.png"))
```

::: notes

  - The pair `face_temporal()` and `face_spatial()` to switch the cubble between the two forms. 
  
  - With `face_temporal()`, the focus of the data is now on the temporal face of the spatio-temporal cube and this corresponds to switch the data to the long form. 
  
  - With `face_spatial()`, the long cubble is switched back to the nested form, the spatial face of the datacube.

<!-- -   Here is a syntax comparison with and without cubble -->

<!-- -   On the right hand side with cubble, you can do some spatial analysis in the nested form, pivot it to the long form for some temporal analysis, and then pivot it back to the nested form for some additional spatial analysis. -->

<!-- -   Sometimes, the spatial analysis include extracting some interesting sites. -->

<!-- - I have highlighted the code you will need to do to pull out some interesting stations and then filter out those station in the temporal data  -->

<!-- -   In cubble, these updates are automatically handled by `face_temporal()` and `face_spatial()`, so you don't need to manually updates your spatial or temporal data to match with the other. -->

<!-- -   Also the cubble pipeline chains all the operations together and there is no intermediate objects created in the workflow. -->

## Cast your data into a cubble

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3"
(weather <- as_cubble(
  list(spatial = stations, temporal = ts),
  key = id, index = date, coords = c(long, lat)
))
```

```{r}
weather <- cubble::climate_aus
```


-   the spatial data (`stations`) can be an `sf` object and temporal data (`ts`) can be a `tsibble` object.

::: notes

  - To cast the two separate tables into a cubble, you can supply them in a named list.

  - You also need to tell cubble some identifiers it looks for

  - The `key` argument is the spatial identifier that connects the two tables.

  - The `index` argument is the temporal identifier that prescribes the timestamp.

  - The `coords` argument is to used to specify the coordinate
  
  [breath]

  - From the cubble header, you can read that the key is `id`, there are 30 stations and it is in the nested form. 

  - The third line here shows you the available temporal variables and their types. 

  - Also, if the spatial and temporal data is an sf or tsibble object, they will be indicated in the header as well.

## Switch between the two forms {.smaller}

::: columns
::: column
long form

```{r echo = FALSE}
options(width = 50)
```

```{r face-temporal, echo = TRUE}
(weather_long <- weather %>% 
  face_temporal())
```

:::

::: column
back to the nested form:

```{r}
#| echo: true
(weather_back <- weather_long %>% 
   face_spatial())

identical(weather_back, weather)
```
:::
:::

::: notes

- Here is what a cubble look like when being switched between the long and the nested form. 

  - With the `weather` object we just created, we turn it into the long form with the function `face_temporal()`

-   Notice that the third line in the header now changes to see the available spatial variables

[breath]

-  On the right, `weather_long` is switched back the nested form with the function `face_spatial()` 

- As you can see from the last line of code, `face_temporal()` and `face_spatial()` are the exact inverse. 

- Hence `weather_back` and `weather` are identical
:::

## Access variables in the other form {.smaller}

```{r}
options(width = 100)
```

Reference temporal variables with `$`

```{r}
#| echo: true
weather %>% 
  mutate(avg_tmax = mean(ts$tmax, na.rm = TRUE))
```

. . .

Move spatial variables into the long form

```{r echo = TRUE}
weather_long %>% unfold(long, lat)
```

::: notes

  - Sometimes, you may need to access variables from the other form for your analysis. 

  - For example, we may want to calculate some per station summary of the time series data. 
  
  - We can refer to the temporal variables from the nested form with the `$` sign.
  
  - Here I'm calculating the average maximum temperature across the whole year for each station and I need to get access to `tmax` from the list-column `ts`.

  - In the long form, you need the cubble verb `unfold()` to move the spatial variables into the long form. 
  
  - Here I move the two coordinate columns into the long form and later we will see how it can help us to create a glyph map.

nasa_bbox <- out %>% st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>% st_bbox()

  geom_glyph(aes(x_major = long, y_major = lat, 
                 x_minor = time, y_minor = diff), width = 2, height = 2) + 
  coord_sf()

:::{.notes}

Here is a typical plot you may have seen when someone tries to visualise their spatio-temporal data. The x and y axes are the coordinates, here I simplify it with only two points, but in reality you may see a collection of points in space or a raster image. Each facet here shows the space in different timestamp and the values are mapped into color. 

The problem of this type of visualisation is that it becomes difficult to comprehend the temporal structure of the data since you have to compare points at the same location across panels to digest the pattern. 

:::

## Why do you need a glyph map?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
glyph_plot
```

:::{.notes}

Instead the temporal pattern is much easier to observe if shown in a time series plot. 

What a glyph map do is to put the time series glyph in the place of the location, so you can see the temporal trend in the space.

## Glyph map transformation

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/glyph-steps.png"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
DATA %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_glyph(
    aes(x_major = X_MAJOR, x_minor = X_MINOR,
        y_major = Y_MAJOR, y_minor = Y_MINOR)) +
  ...
```

::: footer
<https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/cubble/articles/glyph.html>
:::

::: notes
  
  - I have a short illustration to show you how the transformation works

  - Here (1) shows a single station on the map with its long and lat coordinate and (2) is its associated time series. 
  
  - Here you know the range of your x and y axis and you can use linear algebra to transform them into a different scale. 
  
  - In step (3), the time series in still the same but its scale has been transformed to a width of 1 and heights of 0.3 and the center in this scale is where the original point lays. 
  
  -  Once we have the time series in the transformed axes, they can be placed onto the map as in (4)

  - To make a glyph map, you can use the `geom_glyph` function from the cubble package.

  - It requires a pair of major and a pair of minor variable as required aesthetics

  - The major variable are the spatial coordinates, long and lat here and the minor variable are the temporal coordinates, date and tmax here.
